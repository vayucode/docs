Hit Next to enter financial information such as the bank name, account number, IBAN (routing number), Swift code (if relevant) and ABA.

Finally, hit Create.

Once entered, subsidiaries will be listed with the date the entry was created and the tax ID.

## Sync with ERP

You can sync Vayu-entered subsidiaries with those listed in an integrated ERP such as NetSuite.

Choose from a dropdown list of subsidiaries from either side of the integration, and the two entities will sync.

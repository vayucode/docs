## **Invoice Preferences**

Invoice preferences control how invoices are generated, displayed, and sent to customers. These settings apply globally across your workspace.

### **☐ Hide zero amount line items**

Removes invoice line items with a total amount of zero, helping keep invoices clean and easier to read.

### **☐ Hide price breakdown in invoice PDF**

Hides the price calculation columns (such as quantity and unit price) and displays only the total amount per line item in the invoice PDF.

### **☐ Show consumption breakdown of related entities**

Controls whether usage is shown only as an aggregated total or broken down by related child entities when parent–child customers are used.

### **☐ Add payment wallet info on invoice**

Includes payment wallet details on invoices. This may be relevant for customers that accept alternative payment methods such as cryptocurrency.

### **☐ Set issue date and due date upon approval**

Defines how the invoice issue date is determined:

- Use the approval date as issue date, **_or_**
- Use the expected issue date for the billing period, even if the invoice is approved later.

### **☐ Automatically send approved invoices**

Automatically emails invoices to the configured billing contact as soon as they are approved.

### **☐ Deduct credits from following invoice**

Controls how customer credits are applied:

- When enabled, credits are automatically deducted from the next issued invoice.
- When disabled, credits can be applied manually to an invoice of your choice.

### **☐ Include customer portal link**

Adds a link to the [<u>customer portal</u>](https://guide.withvayu.com/documentation/guides/invoices/customer-portal#customer-portal) in invoices, allowing customers to view invoice status and related usage information.

### **Billing email and BCC**

Configures the sender address for invoice emails (billing email) and optional BCC recipients (invoicing bcc address) who should receive a copy of every invoice.
